# BDOAffinity

Simple workaround for the new EAC affinity block without third-party software.

How to use:

- Move both the _startup.vbs and _bdoaffinity.ps1 file in the same folder as BDO's launcher
- Run the Enable BDOAffinity.reg (Press Yes and Ok)
- With any text editor, edit the _BDOAffinity.ps1 file that was moved into the BDO folder and change the Affinity value (Instructions inside _BDOAffinity.ps1)

After those steps are followed once you don't have to do it again, you can just launch the game normally from steam or a shortcut
