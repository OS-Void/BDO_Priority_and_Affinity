# BDOAffinity

Simple workaround for the new EAC affinity block without third-party software.

Simply put the affinity.ps1 file in the same folder as BDO's launcher, right click the file -> properties -> at the bottom click "Unlock" and apply, after that enable it with the registry files, then change the affinity value to your own specification by editing the affinity.ps1 file with any text editor of your choice, after that you can just launch the game normally from steam or a shortcut without having to touch any of the files again!
