# BDO Affinity & Priority tweaks

Simple workaround for the new EAC priority/affinity block without third-party software.

How to use:

- Move the _tweaks.ps1 file in the same folder as BDO's launcher
- Run the "Enable-BDOTweaks.reg" (Press Yes and Ok)
- With any text editor, edit the _tweaks.ps1 file that was moved into the BDO folder and change the Priority and Affinity value (There's more info inside the file)

After those steps are followed once you don't have to do it again, you can just launch the game normally from steam or a shortcut
