# BDOAffinity

Simple workaround for the new EAC affintiy block without third-party software.

Head to your Black Desert Online folder and move the affinity.ps1 file inside the folder where the BlackDesertLauncher.exe is located, then simply use all 3 registry files provided that enables it.

Edit the affinity.ps1 with any editor of your choice, and change the affinity to your own specification
